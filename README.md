# Abstract

In this paper, topics such as reliance on social media, how social media affects the spread of information, and implications that may arise. Data collected from Twitter will be used to visually display and examine how a singular term can spread globally within hours. Using digital tools such as TAGS, RAWGraphs, Voyant, and Google spreadsheets, data will be examined and formed into visual aids to better support the concept that rapid information spreads issues to avid social media users. Furthermore, the correlations between keywords will be demonstrated showing a more in-depth representation of data’s spread and growth. 

# Introduction

When examining information rapidly shared across borders, a common tool that is moderately responsible for ongoing trends is social media. Using platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit,  etc, allows the mass production of content to be shared amongst a high volume of users. Moreover, creating a vast growth in participating geotagged locations. An example of social media fueling the spread of information would be the use of the retweet button on Twitter because anyone in any part of the world can access content much easier due to their friends or users they follow retweeting posts. Social media already caters to our conveniences but now we can physically see how social media provides encouragement to contribute to information and post sharing. Taking into account theories such as the Actor-network theory, the concept of constantly shifting relationships between social and natural worlds explains how the increase in easily accessible content is related to social media usage. 

In research put together by Jason Riddle and UA Little Rock, they study how social media contributes to information and fake news travelling internationally. The article discusses political implications that can occur by the use of influential information within the media. A variety of examples from throughout history were used such as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump’s election. In this study data and findings from past years will be used to support the social media phenomenon that allows information and all forms of content to rapidly spread throughout a multitude of online platforms. Although the information is known to proliferate without the use of the media, the objective of this study is to fixate on how the digital world amplifies this process. 

In this study, data collected from Twitter will be used to visually display and track the spread of keywords through retweets and shares. The keyword used for this study is ‘Kim Kardashian’ as the name is well known globally as well as commonly talked about in the media. The ultimate goal would be to prove that social media is one of the largest contributing factors to the rapid spread of information whether it be factual or not. To take this study one step further the incorporation of the keywords Kim, Kimberly, Kimye, and KimK were used to further examine the extent of information spread. 

# Methodology

This experiment started with a collection of data scraped from Twitter. The data had strong correlations and connections to the keyword ‘Kim Kardashian’. Using the tool TAGS or Twitter archiving google sheet to run search results consistently. That information was then slightly altered to avoid any formatting issues for upcoming steps. The chart TAGS created was then uploaded to RAWGraphs in order to create a visualization that was easier to comprehend (as seen in figure 1). After uploading the data, small changes to the date and time were made to help the program properly understand and display the information being provided. Once the data was prepared, trial and error were used to decide which form of depiction was best based on understandability. Finally, the graph by the name of ‘Arc Diagram’ was decided upon, and after undergoing a couple of changes to the settings the data was well represented (as seen in figure 2). Settings such as width, height, links opacity, and node were used to better display the information coherently. Then the information was simply exported after being examined further.

When looking at the second more in-depth aspect of the study a few new tools were introduced in order to maintain a level of understandability and to ensure the outputted data was produced without any problems. Using the same information scraped from Twitter and then turned into a chart via TAGS, the collected data was then uploaded to Voyant. Once the corpus had been successfully generated it was time to narrow down which graph and corpus tool would best represent the data. Within Voyant three separate corpus tools were used: summary, cirrus, and trends. However, the trend tool was used twice to represent the correlation between the keyword, Kim Kardashian, with Twitter ID strings and then again to display the correlation between the four keywords. When setting up the cirrus tool there weren’t many adjustments involved, only a simple tweak to the terms bar. By moving the terms bar to about the center it allowed more words to appear in the layout which in turn creates a better visualization of the data (as seen in figure 3). When looking at the summary tool the only purpose of including this information in the finding is to provide the exact amount of time the keywords were mentioned (as seen in Figure 4). Nonetheless, this information is important when judging the scale of the experiment. In figure 5  the first trends graph focused on the keywords Kim, Kimberly, KimK, and Kimye is found. This chart was only adjusted slightly by choosing the terms displayed. The last trends graph that represents the relationship between the term KimKardashian and user’s ID strings did not undergo any changes (refer to figure 6). The data collected from these more in-depth studies were then simply exported for further examination.

# Results
With most generations that have been exposed to technology, social media is used as one of our communication tools. Therefore, the demographic is not limited to just a generation or location; it is a globally spread and for the most part a globally inclusive phenomenon. The participants used in this experiment are those who actively use Twitter. As seen in figure 2, the United States, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and China are the most prominent locations where this subject is discussed. Based on the dense areas on the graph, we can determine where the information is being received and retweeted from. There are multiple reasons for some areas discussing the topic in higher volumes than others, this can be determined by further research. 

When examining the results provided in both figure 1 and figure 2, it is evident that a simple hashtag or keyword can travel globally on social media at a much more rapid speed than any other form of instant communication. When looking at figure 2, the dense lines or connections are all attached to locations that are known for heavy use of technological gadgets and therefore social media platforms. The data collected overall begins to prove that the use of social media is a main contributing factor to the spread of information, However, not all of the information spread is entirely factual by any means. If someone with fame attached to their name or a brand decides to post something on a social media platform, their fans or followers that see it may mistake it as factual and begin the rapid spread of this new information that is not true. This is an example of how information can be used to influence individuals or depending on the nature of the content, persuade individuals into forming a biased opinion. 

When looking at figure 4 it is evident that not only the name Kim Kardashian was used to spread posts. By using slight variations or nicknames a vast amount of new posts and mentions surface. Therefore, displaying an abundance of proof that social media is a high determinant for what information is spread. Furthermore as seen in the chart presenting the correlation between nicknames and name variations, the word Kim still holds a fluctuating but high placement on the chart (refer to figure 5). The high volume of tweets containing just the word Kim seems to be the closest to the results following the keyword Kim Kardashian in terms of words mentioned in posts and retweets. When examining figure 3 one of the largest words visually displayed are our keywords. Thus, providing a scope of how often the word is used in relation to ‘http’ because ‘http’ would be connected to every post as it is an online platform. Overall, when examining the data collected it displays a strong relationship between the words in question. Moreover, allowing the question of why is social media responsible for high volumes of information spread? 

# Analysis

All things considered, social media was designed to present users with a flow of posts. In turn, these posts contain the information in question. By participating in a platform built to circulate and share information across networks everyone will inevitably be exposed to new content daily. With a social media app such as Twitter, it is not uncommon for your feed to exhibit a widespread of diversified content. However, it is up to the user to contribute to the spread of this information or to let the post continue on its path. It may be a trivial amount of ‘FOMO’ or the fear of missing out,  at play but most people will continue to participate in the dissemination of posts. “ representation of knowledge is as crucial to its cultural force as any other facet of its production” (Drucker, 2011) When considering the vast topics shared amongst platforms one should also take into consideration what information they help to promote. There is a fine line between factual information and contributing to misinformation. Ultimately, how social media increasingly became more responsible for high volumes of information spread is a subject that requires in-depth research to understand the innumerable factors at play.

# Discussion

Overall, when reflecting on the results provided by the experiment conducted it is clear that social media impacts the volume of information spread. Based on the research and data collected the ultimate question is, how much of an impact does this phenomenon have on the forms of information an individual receives. When speaking to individuals who are not active social media users, the gap between those who are aware of certain global issues and those who are not is predominant. Social media users have a tendency to be exposed to more diversified information pools than those who are not active on social platforms. As mentioned in the article above, “Information passed by social media can change the belief of an individual or a group” (Jason Riddle, 2017). When looking at the overall study I have conducted, I understand there are certain limitations that my data present such as; why a specific location has a higher information spread density than another, the data used for this study was based on a single keyword where different data entries obscure the results, the statistics gathered are not exact but are presented as a visual representation. Ultimately after reviewing the results of this study, the question of what would happen if social media communication channels became inactive still remains. How do we as a society that is codependent on the digital world successfully spread information without convenient tools such as social media platforms?
